# TensorFlow Models fork for building RNN variants of AstroNet

This repository was forked to build an RNN and GRU variant of AstroNet, as well as use the AstroNet FC and CNN code for experiments. These experiments are conducted as part of my master thesis "Comparing convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks for exoplanet detection" for Data Science: Business and Governance at Tilburg University.

All supplementary code for the RNNs and GRUs is currently under construction and not usable in practice. Updates will be provided on this page.

Update 21-10-2018: The experiments with the FC and CNN models have been conducted. Performance data is stored under astronet/models and can be accessed using TensorBoard.
